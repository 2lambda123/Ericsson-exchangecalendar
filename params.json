Ericsson and the Ericsson QA team are grateful for the help and hard work of many [contributors][contributors] like yourself.\r\n\r\nCurrent Release Vs. Download trend is something like [this](https://rawgit.com/muthusuba/github-tools/master/downloads-trend.html?user=Ericsson&repo=exchangecalendar)\r\n\r\n\r\nGetting involved as a contributor\r\n------------------------------------------\r\nWe love working with contributors for Exchange EWS Provider, but it does require a few skills. You will need to know some Javascript, XUL, some CSS and a basic familiarity with GitHub.\r\n\r\nIf you know some Javascript, it's worth having a look at the Object Oriented Programming to understand the basic concepts of class based coding and especially for xul window objects. \r\n\r\nIf you need to brush-up on programming, but are eager to start contributing immediately, please consider helping us find bugs in Github [Exchange EWS Provider][Exchange EWS Provider] or find bugs in the Issues tested by the [EricssonQA][EricssonQA] team. To brush up on Javascript skills before engaging with us, Dive Into Javascript [mozilla][mozilla] is an excellent resource. W3schools also has [notes on Javascript][w3schools] available through their website.  The programming concepts you will need to know include functions, working with classes, and some object-oriented programming basics. To brush up on XUL, Mozilla [XUL][XUL] is an easy and simple place to learn XUL, More of XUL are dynamically configured and cross-plateform.\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to all our [contributors][contributors]\r\n\r\n[w3schools]:  http://www.w3schools.com/js/\r\n[mozilla]:  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide\r\n[EricssonQA]:  https://github.com/Ericsson/exchangecalendar/\r\n[Exchange EWS Provider]:  https://github.com/Ericsson/exchangecalendar/issues\r\n[XUL]:  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/Overlay_Extensions/XUL_School\r\n[contributors]: https://github.com/Ericsson/exchangecalendar/contributors\r\n\r\nQuestions are always welcome\r\n----------------------------\r\nWhile we take pains to keep our documentation updated, the best source of information is those of us who work on the project. We also have the [wiki][wiki] pages to answer your general questions about contributing to Exchange EWS Provider.\r\n\r\n[wiki]:   https://github.com/Ericsson/exchangecalendar/wiki\r\n \r\nGetting set up\r\n-------------\r\nIt's easy to get set up: just 2 pieces of software to install and in few command lines you'll be running the addon!\r\n\r\n### Install Thunderbird\r\nIf you don't already have it installed, please install latest version\r\nhttps://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/installing-thunderbird\r\n\r\n### Install Lightning\r\nIf you don't already have it installed, please install latest version\r\nhttps://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/installing-lightning-thunderbird\r\n\r\n### Cloning the test repository with Git\r\nAfter you have installed [Git] you will need to clone the project to your hard drive. From your workspace directory run this command which will copy (clone) the project to your hard drive\r\n\r\n    git clone --recursive git://github.com/Ericsson/exchangecalendar.git\r\n[Git]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_%28software%29\r\n\r\n### Installing developement tools\r\nYou will need to install Dom Inspector, Javascript Debugger and some other development tools. Fortunately `Thunderbird addons` makes it easy to install all of these: \r\n  \r\nNow using bash we'll compile the addon we need (which are written in wiki)\r\n\r\n    cd ./exchangecalendar_master; chmod +x ./build.sh; ./build.sh;\r\n\r\nNow you can install the Exchange EWS Provider addon\r\n\r\nWriting Code\r\n-------------\r\nIf you want to get involved and add more code, then there's just a few things\r\nwe'd like to ask you to do:\r\n\r\n1. Use the similar code format for all new developement and window objects \r\n2. Follow mozilla's simple [Coding Style Guide][Coding Style Guide] recommendations\r\n3. Fork this project with your own GitHub account\r\n4. Make sure all tests are passing and submit a pull request with your changes\r\n\r\n[Coding Style Guide]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/Coding_Style\r\n \r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\nThis software is licensed under the [GNU GPL] Version 3 \r\n[GNU GPL]: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html \r\n\r\nReadme template file courtesy: [mozwebqa-test-templates][mozwebqa-test-templates]\r\n[mozwebqa-test-templates]: https://github.com/mozilla/mozwebqa-test-templates\r\n","google":"UA-64103011-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
